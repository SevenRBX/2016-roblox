# Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

2. If you don't already have it, install an LTS version of node

3. Enter the directory of the repository in a terminal and run `npm i`

4. Create a file called `config.json`. You can play with this more later, but the easiest way to get started is to copy the file `config.example.json` and name it `config.json`

5. This step varies depending on your intentions:

**Release:** Run `npm run build`, then `npm run start`

**Debug/Dev:** Run `npm run dev`
