# Quick Start

1. Clone the repository

2. If you don't already have it, install an LTS version of node

3. Enter the directory of the repository in a terminal and run `npm i`

4. Run `node ./util/create_config.js`. This will create a basic config.json file that you can edit later.

5. This step varies depending on your intentions:

**Release:** Run `npm run build`, then `npm run start`

**Debug/Dev:** Run `npm run dev`
